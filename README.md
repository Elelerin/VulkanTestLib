Notes: using const for the model paths. Later will allow (require) dynamic loading of models
 - from implementation of either an internal console or something. Regardless, there will be a way.
 - The best way would be to hard-code in paths. Dynamic loading is 'cool' but also unnecessary for the sake of performance. If someone wants to mod this down the line that's cool, but it's also out of scope.
